## abstract
- a "refine and recycle" method applicable to LZ77-type decompressors & implementation in reconfigurable logic
- refine the write commands(for literal tokens) & read commands(for copy tokens) a set of commands that target a single bank of block ram, and rather than performing all the dependency calculations saves logic by recycling (read) commands that return with an invalid result.
- A single “Snappy” decompressor implemented in reconfigurable logic leveraging this method is capable of processing multiple literal or copy tokens per cycle and achieves up to 7.2GB/s, which can keep pace with an NVMe device.

### 6.5 impacts of # of BCPs


### 6.6 comparison of decompression accelerators

By using 6 BCPs, output up to 31B per cycle at a clock frequency of 250MHz

around 14.5x and 3.7x faster then the prior work on ZLIB[18] and Snappy
more area-efficient, measured in MB/s per 1K LUTs and MB/s per BRAM (36kb), which is 1.4x more LUT efficient than the ZLIB implementation in [18] and 2.4x more BRAM efficient than the Snappy implementation in [25].
the Vitis Data Compression Library (VDCL) 25x and 4x faster than a single engine implementation and an 8-engine implementation
